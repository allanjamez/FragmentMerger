FragmentMerger is a simple ASP.NET Core MVC web app that reconstructs a document from overlapping text fragments using a greedy merge strategy.

Inspired by genome sequencing techniques, this tool uses the longest overlapping pairs first to combine fragments until only one remains â€” effectively solving a simplified version of the shortest common superstring problem.

##  Features
- Enter or Paste your own fragments (one per line)
- Click "Merge Fragments" to reconstruct the full text
- Try random sample fragment sets
